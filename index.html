        <p>Hey there! My name is Julie. I'm 24 years old and looking to radically change my career by getting into tech. I've always thought the concept of coding seemed so incredibly cool, but I never thought I could actually get into it.</p>
        <p>Fresh out of high school, I decided to move away from home to go to school for Statistics and Economics. I've always been good at math, but a couple years into the program, I realized that kind of career wasn't for me. So I left, and I fell into the car industry. It has taught me a lot of things and I'm beyond greatful to have met the people that I have, but again... something still wasn't quite right.</p>
        <p>Coding was something that seemed compeletely daunting, and I didn't think I could do it. But then I realized, why exactly am I underestimating myself? Life is short! There's no time for self doubt. Lo and behold, I got started in a coding bootcamp through the University of Toronto on a whim, and I've been loving every second of it.</p>
        <p>So far, the journey has been a good one. Working a full time job, a part time job, and having the bootcamp three nights a week has kept me busy beyond belief, but I have a good support system comprising of my mother and best friends who are always there for me. I've been learning so much and I'm looking forward to learning new things every day!</p>
        <p>Beyond work and school, I enjoy cooking, camping, and the occasional Netflix binge. Who doesn't?</p>
        <p>With that being said, thank you so much for taking the time to check out my page. Let's code!</p>
